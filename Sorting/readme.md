Sorting Algorithms
============
Common Terms
------
* **In-place**: In-place sorting algorithms use no extra data structure.

* **Stable**: Stable sorting algorithms maintain the order of elements with the same value as they appear in the input array.

* **Time/Space Analysis (Big-O, Big-Ω, Big-ϴ)**: Describes the performance of an algorithm as a function of the input size.
